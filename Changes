# Changes for DarkPAN::Creator

1.21 - Wed May 20 14:32:45 2009
	* Handle exit on our own to prevent applications using
	an embedded indexer from stopping prematurely.

1.18_04 - Sat May  9 02:07:47 2009
	* Worked out some inheritance issues. I really need to use
	roles.

1.18_03 - Fri May  8 16:04:26 2009
	* Clean up dist
	* Fix problem with _exit inherited from MyCPAN::Indexer. This 
	killed applications embedding the DPAN indexer
