# Changes for DarkPAN::Creator

1.28_02 - Mon Nov 30 17:49:29 2009
	* Completely redo how the Minimal reporter decides which 
	packages to include in the report. It looks at the package 
	name and compares it to the file. If it looks like they
	are the same, that one wins even if another file has the
	same package with a higher version. Otherwise, only the
	highest version of a package gets into the report.

1.28 - Fri Nov 20 05:44:47 2009
	* Put relative paths in the indexer reports if you're
	using the organize dists option.
	* Update prereqs to latest version of MyCPAN::Indexer
	and CPAN::PackageDetails.

1.27 - Sun Nov  8 02:33:58 2009
	* Now you can set the Log4perl config file with the
	DPAN_LOG4PERL_FILE.
	* Refactored some bits in the Minimal reporter to 
	make it easier to override the bits that decide
	which reports to index.

1.22 - Thu May 21 17:44:59 2009
	* Don't index packages (such as bytes, DB, MM) that are special
	* Don't try to index tests. We don't need them to make DPAN

1.21 - Wed May 20 14:32:45 2009
	* Handle exit on our own to prevent applications using
	an embedded indexer from stopping prematurely.

1.18_04 - Sat May  9 02:07:47 2009
	* Worked out some inheritance issues. I really need to use
	roles.

1.18_03 - Fri May  8 16:04:26 2009
	* Clean up dist
	* Fix problem with _exit inherited from MyCPAN::Indexer. This 
	killed applications embedding the DPAN indexer
